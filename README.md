latest update: 'switched' over to arrangement.js file and set up random distribution of 9 species.
improved some glaring issues and made things as plain as possible to read

Initial stages!
I'm building an object-oriented system to support randomly arranged/ naturally varying illustrations of NZ's 9 moa species. Currently I have created a class template.

Here is the code I built from the ground up before trying to adapt it to this project file

I tried to build a flock array (I'm calling this a Kahui) from scratch to understand how to encapsulate this code in a class for flocking properties.. 
I fixed the issues I had with class instantiation, and realised this isn't very necessary. 
This is very much still in progress, and I would rather apply it to the generator system here is I can.
