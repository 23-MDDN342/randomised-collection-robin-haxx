**PROJECT 2: PROCEDURAL EXTINCT NATIVE AVIAN SPECIES NATURAL VARIATION DIGITAL ILLUSTRATION !!**

![Final Screenshot](readme_assets\lastVer.jpg)

I'm approaching this project as a programming + data visualization exercise first, rather than a design assignment, so my focus was on finding clear and simple methods of visualizing the systems I was building. <br>
This project is an object- oriented tool for creating "collections" of Moa, distributed according to how rare the best natural historians reckon they were, and illustrating their relative sizes and preferred habitat. <br>
I started by using colour to represent what habitat each species occupied, and in the final stages focused on using what we know about each species' variation (beak and plumage) to give each of the 9 its own visual character.<br>
I was initially inspired by the entomologist George Hudson, as he documented his samples of NZ insects with beautiful illustrations and pushed for naturalism to be more accessible to people without formal scientific education. <br>

It later became inspired by the sources I used in researching the Moa <br>

My best source of information so far has been this book. Incredibly helpful, well written for how scientific it is and pretty up to date.<br>
Worthy, T. H., and Richard N. Holdaway. The Lost World of the Moaâ€¯: Prehistoric Life of New Zealand. Indiana University Press, 2002.

For the "size" trait I used their estimated heights - note that this may not translate to head size in the same way for all species.
Most of the information I was referring to after my initial research is the overviews on New Zealand Birds Online.

A blog post where I talk about the project + Moa natural history in more detail:

If there's anything I'd criticise about this program, it's that the population counts aren't based off of particularly accurate data, but this isn't too bad of an issue as I only needed to convey a general sense of each species' relative rarity.
I do think with a third party to verify the data I used, this project would be ready to be used as an educational resource.
I'm more than happy with how I've not just represented some data but built an adaptable system for categorizing species data and writing almost plain-text code to reflect that data in visual elements and conditional statements - it wouldn't be near as much of a task now to create a similar program for the five native species of kiwi, for example.
