**PROJECT 2: PROCEDURAL EXTINCT NATIVE AVIAN SPECIES NATURAL VARIATION DIGITAL ILLUSTRATION !!**

I'm approaching this project as a programming + data visualization exercise first, rather than a design assignment, so my focus was on finding clear and simple methods of visualizing the systems I was building. <br>
This project is an object- oriented tool for creating "collections" of Moa, distributed according to how rare the best natural historians reckon they were, and illustrating their relative sizes and preferred habitat. <br>
I was the entomologist George Hudson, as he documented his samples of NZ insects with beautiful illustrations and pushed for naturalism to be more accessible to people without formal scientific education. <br>

It later became inspired by the sources I used in researching the Moa <br>

My best source of information so far has been this book. Incredibly helpful, well written for how scientific it is and pretty up to date.<br>
Worthy, T. H., and Richard N. Holdaway. The Lost World of the Moaâ€¯: Prehistoric Life of New Zealand. Indiana University Press, 2002.

For the "size" trait I used their estimated heights - note that this may not translate to head size in the same way for all species.
Most of the information I was referring to after my initial research is the overviews on New Zealand Birds Online.

A blog post where I talk about the project + Moa natural history in more detail:

The population counts aren't based off of particularly accurate data, and I wouldn't say that this commit is ready to be used as an educational resource.
However, I figured out how to adapt all the sorts of information I could think of in the different sections of the code.
