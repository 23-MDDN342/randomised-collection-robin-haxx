Initial stages!
I'm building an object-oriented system to support randomly arranged/ naturally varying illustrations of NZ's 9 moa species. Currently I have created a class template.

Here is the code I built from the ground up before trying to adapt it to this project file

This had the problem of rendering each species' size either as a static value or morphing each frame depending on whether stuff was defined in the draw loop or not.
I tried to build a flock array (I'm calling this a Kahui) from scratch to understand how to do this. 
This is very much still in progress, and I would rather apply it to the generator system here is I can.
