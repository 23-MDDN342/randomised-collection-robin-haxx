latest updates: 
1. I implemented the system for habitat- based colour during a coworking session with the Protostars cohort 
(Also tried my best at doing an explainer video of the code so far https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reh5eLW4csU)

Since then, I've hooked up a simple way to use both variables at once, drawing a colourful "outline" for biome and keeping the Island- dependent base colour. Keeping these two colour sets distinct is the important part, so a more realistic secondary colour may not be the best idea.

Also, I got rid of the two rightmost columns for a title and key! Most aspects of which are tied directly to the existing data structure, so for example colour changes and item rearrangement will be directly reflected by the key, and adding more entries to the key will only need minor formatting changes. Feeling like a proper web dev here.

Initial stages!
This project is an object-oriented system of randomly arranged/ naturally varying illustrations of NZ's 9 moa species.
